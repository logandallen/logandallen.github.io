      <p>I am a student at the <a href="https://www.ewsd.org/CTE">Center for Technology Essex</a> and part of the <a href="https://www.cawdvt.org">Computer Animation Web Design</a> (CAWD) program. I am also an aspiring animator and 3D artist. I spend my time creating art digitally and traditionally and am proficient in Adobe programs and blender. I enjoy working on art outside of the classroom, create animations, and learning new things. In 2018 - 2019 I worked at UVM creating 3D models for prototype medical devices. This was a good experience but it made me realize I would like to focus more on an art-related career path rather than engineering.</p>

      <p>I attended CAWD 1 in my junior year of High School. Here I learned many things about web development, graphic design, and 3D modeling. I enjoyed this program and field so much that I went on to CAWD 2 the following year. Here I have learned skills in photography and expanded my skills within the Adobe suite. During CAWD 1, I was inducted into the national technical honor society and remain part of it today. I was also awarded student of the year within CAWD.</p>

      <p>In the future, I hope to go to college and graduate with a bachelorâ€™s degree in a field related to animation, game design, or 3D art. I enjoy design and want to find a career that combines design with art, and work along with side other people.</p>
